# Introduction

## Write some code
```bash
# Enable dependency tracking for code
$ go mod init example/hello

# Run go code
$ go run .

# All go commands
$ go help
```

## Call code in an external package
You can use the pkg.go.dev site to find published modules whose packages have functions you can use in your own code.

```bash
# go.sum file is created and used for authenticating the module
$ go mod tidy

$ go run .
```
